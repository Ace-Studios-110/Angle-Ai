## üé® UI Components

All components are built with:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Radix UI** for accessible components
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## üîÑ Integration with Angel Interface

These systems work seamlessly behind the Angel interface:
- Users interact only with Angel
- Specialized agents provide expert guidance
- RAG research enhances responses
- Service providers are recommended contextually
- Interactive commands provide targeted assistance

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Parallel processing**: Multiple research sources queried simultaneously
- **Caching**: Research results cached for repeated queries
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoints include rate limiting
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed research
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress indicators for long operations

## üß™ Testing

All components include:
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and fallbacks
- **Loading states**: Progress indicators and loading animations
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first responsive layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

This implementation provides a comprehensive, research-backed, and user-friendly system for business support that aligns with the "Founder and Angel Experience" document requirements.
